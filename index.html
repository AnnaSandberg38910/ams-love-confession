               <p class="pc-confession">ams, i love you too much. 
                              there're too many reasons to count why you're the most important person to me but i do know i want to spend my life with you. the reason aren't stupid nt feelings, i just feel you're the person who understands me and if doesnt understand (though you have too much cognitive empathy to 'not understand') still exepts. i feel comfortable around you. i don't have that strong driving desire around you and this is how i understand you're special to me. i don't believe our relationship ever becomes toxic and like i said too many times - this is the most healthy relatioships from both sides i've even been in and probably ever could be in. honestly, i can't believe such caring, intelligent and interesting person exists and has those qualities at the same time but the most bewildering is reciprocal liking and i believe i have to spend years to grasp on it. i want to make you feel good about yourself and i want you love love yourself as i do.
